This web page hosts the GDemo application, which should run in a 
pop-up window. Note: you will not be able to see the red square or the blue
circle until you finish Task 0.

<h3>Note: Make sure that you have compiled your project first (using Build
  Project) and that pop-ups are not blocked by your web browser. </h3>
<h3>Refreshing this web page should re-run your program.</h3>
<h3>You will have to manually close the pop-up window. (The "QUIT" button does
not work.) </h3>
